# Mars Rover

LINK: http://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata

> Develop an API that moves a rover around on a grid.
> You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N, S, E, W) it is facing.
> The rover receives a character array of commands.
> Implement commands that move the rover forward/backwards (f,b).
> Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
> Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
